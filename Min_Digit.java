/*
    Min Digit 
    Tom and Jerry are playing a game with an integer N that doesn't contain any zeros in its decimal representation. 
    Tom starts first and, on his turn, he can swap any two digits of the integer that are in different positions. 
    Jerry follows by always removing the last digit of the integer. The game continues in turns until 
    there's only one digit left. Determine the smallest integer Tom can achieve at the end if he plays optimally.

Input Format
The first and only line of input consists an integer N consisting of digits 1 - 9.

Output Format
Print the the smallest integer that Tom can achieve.

Constraints
10 < N < 109

Example
Input
132

Output
1

Explanation

Tom can swap 3 and 1, N becomes 312. After that Jerry deletes the last digit, N becomes 31. 
Then Tom swaps 3 and 1, N becomes 13 and Jerry deletes 3, so the answer is 1.
