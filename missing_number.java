/*268. Missing Number

Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]

Output: 2

Explanation:

n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1]

Output: 2

Explanation:

n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]

Output: 8

Explanation:

n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.*/


// Brute Force (tc-O(n^2))

class Solution1 {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;

        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            boolean found = false;

            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (nums[j] == i) {
                    found = true;
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (!found) {
                return i;
            }
        }

        return -1; 
    }
}


//Optimized (tc-O(n))

class Solution2 {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        int n=nums.length;
        int sum=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            sum +=nums[i];
        }
        int sum1=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n+1;i++)
        {
            sum1 +=i;
        }
        return (sum1 - sum);
    }
}
